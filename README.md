## About this Project
This is my final project for the Web Technologies course. I have designed and built a personal portfolio website to showcase my coding skills and future projects.

The website includes the following pages:
1.  Home
2.  Contact
3.  About
4.  Resumé
5.  Projects
6.  Sample Project

I created this site using semantic HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. The design is "mobile-first," meaning it works great on phones and screens of all sizes.

## Colour Scheme
These are the main colours I selected for the website design:

| Name       | RGB            | HEX        |
|------------|----------------|------------|
| Black      | 0, 0, 0        | #000000  | 
| White      | 255, 255, 255  | #FFFFFF  |
| Iron Gray  | 76, 87, 96     | #4c5760  |
| Cool Steel | 147, 168, 172  | #93A8AC  |
| Sand Dune  | 215, 206, 178  | #D7CEB2  |
| Khaki Baige| 165, 158, 140  | #A59E8C  |
| Dim Grey   | 102, 99, 91    | #66635B  |

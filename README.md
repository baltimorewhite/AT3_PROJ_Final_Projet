## About this Project
This is my final project for the Web Technologies course. I have designed and built a personal portfolio website to showcase my coding skills and future projects.

The website includes the following pages:
1.  Home
2.  About me
3.  Resumé
4.  Projects
5.  Contact


I created this site using semantic HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. The design is "mobile-first," meaning it works great on phones and screens of all sizes.

## Colour Scheme
These are the main colours I selected for the website design:

| Name    | RGB            | HEX     |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| White   | 255, 255, 255  | #FFFFFF |
| Black   | 0, 0, 0        | #000000 |
| Indigo  | 79, 70, 229    | #4F46E5 |
| Slate   | 15, 23, 42     | #0F172A |
| Gray    | 75, 85, 99     | #4B5563 |
| Red-500 | 239, 68, 68    | #EF4444 |

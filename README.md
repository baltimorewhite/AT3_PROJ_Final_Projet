## About this Project
This is my final project for the Web Technologies course. I have designed and built a personal portfolio website to showcase my coding skills and future projects.

The website includes the following pages:
1.  Home
2.  Contact
3.  About
4.  Resumé
5.  Projects
6.  Sample Project

I created this site using semantic HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. The design is "mobile-first," meaning it works great on phones and screens of all sizes.

## Colour Scheme
These are the main colours I selected for the website design:

| Name     | RGB            | HEX      |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| Black    | 0, 0, 0        | #000000  |
| White    | 255, 255, 255  | #FFFFFF  |
| [Color 1]| rrr, ggg, bbb  | #RRGGBB  |
| [Color 2]| rrr, ggg, bbb  | #RRGGBB  |
| [Color 3]| rrr, ggg, bbb  | #RRGGBB  |
| [Color 4]| rrr, ggg, bbb  | #RRGGBB  |
